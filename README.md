## Overview

**Wiki**: https://github.com/TDodge/Bike_Project/wiki

## Objective

1. **Data Extraction** - Extract data programmatically from online bike listings using Python
2. **Data Pipelines / ETL** - Create a data pipeline to parse, clean and store extracted data in an SQL database
3. **Event Triggering** - Send automated emails when a desired bike becomes available

The initial scope is to track **Trek** bikes available on **eBay**. The v1 objective is to execute the full pipeline (extract, store, analyze) on a narrow set of parameters before accounting for all brands and different websites where bikes and other high ticket recreation items are available for sale.

The long term vision of this project is to create a program where users input a desired high ticket recreation item (vans, hydrofoils, bikes, skis, surfboards, etc...) and the best options are returned to the user after scouring numerous online marketplaces. In other words, a kayak.com for recreational equipment.

## Purpose
1. **Commercial Potential** - If executed successfully, this solution can provide substantial value to customers by saving them time and money
2. **Technical Development** - The successful execution of this project relies on acquiring skills in many useful areas: data extraction, web scraping, data parsing, data pipelines, process automation, data storage & cloud infrastructure, event triggering, and eventually machine learning and natural language processing
